# How to collect and tag your MP3s properly

For everything to work as expected, you need to add all your collected audio quotes as MP3 files in this directory.

Furthermore, you shoud tag your MP3 files as follows:

 * The `artist` tag should contain the person being quoted -- e.g. `Neil Armstrong`.
 * The `title` tag should contain the context of the quote -- e.g. `First Moon Walk`.
 * The `album` tag should contain the name of the source of the quote -- e.g. `NASA`.
 * The `comment` tag should contain a single line, which is a URL pointing to where you got the quote from (try to be as accurate as possible, but consider whether linking to a page containing the source audio would honour your source better than linking directly to the source audio) -- e.g. `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frase_de_Neil_Armstrong.ogg`.
